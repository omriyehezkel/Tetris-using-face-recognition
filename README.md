Tetris with Face Recognition
This project is a web-based Tetris game that incorporates face recognition using JavaScript and Haar Cascade files. The game can be played on any modern web browser and requires access to the user's camera.

***Installation***

To run the game, simply download the code from the repository or clone it using Git. Once the code is downloaded, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. The following are the steps to get started:

Install Node.js on your machine.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command **npm install** to install the required packages.

***Usage***

To play the game, you will need to run a local web server. One popular way to do this is by using the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code. Here are the steps to follow:

Install Visual Studio Code on your machine.
Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code.
Install the "Live Server" extension by going to the Extensions tab and searching for "Live Server" in the Marketplace.
Click on the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner of the editor or right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".
This will start a local web server and open the game in your default browser. The game will prompt you to grant access to your camera.

***The game controls***

Close right eye: Move the tetromino to the right.

Close left eye: Move the tetromino to the left.

Open mouth: Rotate the tetromino clockwise.

The face recognition feature uses the Haar Cascade files to recognize your facial expressions. When you close your right eye, the tetromino moves to the right. When you close your left eye, the tetromino moves to the left. When you open your mouth, the tetromino rotates clockwise.


***Credits***
This project was created by Omri Yehezkel. The face recognition feature is implemented using the Haar Cascade files and the Open CV library.
